Typed constant expressions

const double pi = 3.1415926;
const char tab = '\t';

Preprocessor definitions (#define)
Another mechanism to name constant values is the use of preprocessor definitions. They have the following form:

#define identifier replacement
#define PI 3.14159
#define NEWLINE '\n'

Input Format:
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i].
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a) and j(an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

Output Format:
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer denoting the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of q lines of output.

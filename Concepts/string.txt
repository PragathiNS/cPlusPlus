Introduction to strings
An example of compound type is the string class.
Variables of this type are able to store sequences of characters, such as words or sentences. A very useful feature!

We need to include the header where the type is defined within the standard library (header <string>) to declare and use objects of this type.
#include <string>

Initialization formats:
string mystring = "This is a string";
string mystring ("This is a string");
string mystring {"This is a string"};

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  string mystring;

  //Initial value
  mystring = "This is the initial string content";
  cout << mystring << endl;

  //value changed during execution
  mystring = "This is a different string content";
  cout << mystring << endl;
  return 0;
}

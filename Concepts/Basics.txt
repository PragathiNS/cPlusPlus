NAMESPACE
std::cout --> explicit qualification,

using namespace std; --> using declarations
cout --> unqualified manner

cout is part of the standard library, and all the elements in the standard C++ library are declared within what is called a namespace: the namespace std.

In order to refer to the elements in the std namespace a program shall either
qualify each and every use of elements of the library (as we have done by prefixing cout with std::), or introduce visibility of its components.
The most typical way to introduce visibility of these components is by means of using declarations:

using namespace std;


endl
inserting the endl manipulator ends the line (printing a newline character and flushing the stream).


The return value of main
return 0;

value	        description
0	            The program was successful
EXIT_SUCCESS	The program was successful (same as above).
              This value is defined in header <cstdlib>.
EXIT_FAILURE	The program failed.
              This value is defined in header <cstdlib>.
